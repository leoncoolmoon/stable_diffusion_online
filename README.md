# stable diffusion and web UI on google colab
stable_diffusion_online</br>
I found two versions:</br>
 The fast version reinstall everything every time and load model and extension from the google drive</br>
 </br>
 The slow version install in the google drive, the SD+webUI itself will take about 12GB</br>
